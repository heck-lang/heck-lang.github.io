			<h3>It's hecking fast!</h3>

			This is the official hub page (for now) for the <a href="https://github.com/mashpoe/heck">Heck programming language</a>. This domain will also be used to host the CDN that will allow you to run Heck code on your website. You won't <i>need</i> the CDN for Heck to work on your website, as you can compile it to WebAssembly ahead of time (which is recommended), but if that won't work for you or you just want a quick way to test your code without having to manually compile it each time, this CDN will allow you to run Heck code just like JavaScript with a custom script tag like so: <code>&lt;script type="heck"&gt;</code>.
			<br>
			<br>
			The CDN will simply be a small script that looks for the special script tags, and if it finds any, it will load in the lightweight Heck compiler, which is just a WebAssembly module that will turn your Heck source code into its own WebAssembly module. The compiler will then be unloaded.
			<br>
			<br>
			Heck is ideal for parts of your code where performance is key, and it will be able to communicate with JavaScript code in a very simple and efficient way.
			<br>
			<br>
			Heck won't be used exclusively on the web, but that will be its first target. Eventually, Heck will be able to produce native executables (if you couldn't tell by now, it's a compiled language), and it will also be used as an embedded language with a JIT. Heck is built on multiple philosophies, but they all ultimatley boil down to the idea that the purpose of a programming language is to make programs easy for both humans and computers to understand, and that means it will be simple yet powerful, and it will compile and run extremely quickly.
			<br>
			<br>
			As it stands, there is no complete implementation of Heck, but you can follow the <a href="https://heck-lang.blogspot.com">creator's blog</a> in the meantime in order to get updates!
